# Pong For Arduino Gamer
##By Joseph Pullan (Fezodge III)

This is the game Pong for the Arduino Gamer board.

Try to beat all ten levels. As you progress through the game, each level will become harder, either making your paddle shorter or the ball moving faster!

*Please Note: Some of the animations may be/are broken. I will try to fix this when I have time, but I'm quite busy right now. If someone would like to do it for me, then go ahead!*
